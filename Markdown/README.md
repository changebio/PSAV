This application was developed with XYZ journal Methods as described in this http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed editorial. 

The application allows users to calculate PSA velocity using http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17197071 three methods from Connolly D paper:
1. Arithmetic equation of change in PSA over time (AE)
2. Linear regression (LR)
3. Rate of PSA change using first and last values only (FL)

A data matrix can be pasted into the application.

PSA Velocity code can be run locally via https://github.com/zx8754/PSA_Velocity .
